    "I am interested in determining the factors that best predict a data scientist's salary based on the given information. Therefore, I will choose Salary In USD be my variable of interest (the response), and the rest of the variables being the explanatory variables to find out what factors have a strong correlation with salary. <br> And my question for research will be **\"What are the variables that best predict one's salary?\"** and it will be focused on prediction."
